# Server side Framework
It uses nodejs and express js as server side framework. Express is the most common Node JS web application framework that deals with exploring various code  which we need on a frequent basis like POST body / query string parsing. Express.js basically helps you manage everything, from routes, to handling requests and views

#Client side Framework
It uses angularjs as client side framework. AngularJs has better data binding, DOM manipulation and it is light and very clean and involves simple manipulations.Good frameworks can help architect our code so that it is modular (therefore reusable), DRY, readable, performant and secure.
