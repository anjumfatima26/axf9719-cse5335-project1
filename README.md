# Server side Framework
It uses Node JS and Express JS as server side framework. Express is the most common Node JS web application framework that deals with exploring various code  which we need on a frequent basis like POST body / query string parsing. Express JS basically helps you manage everything, from routes, to handling requests and views

#Client side Framework
It uses Angular JS as client side framework. Angular JS has better data binding, DOM manipulation and it is light and very clean and involves simple manipulations.Good frameworks can help architect our code so that it is modular (therefore reusable), DRY, readable, performant and secure. 

# Steps to run
This github code can be used to deploy on Heroku. It fetches data from a MongoLab database. Or it can be run on local machine with mongodb running and server running on port 8000.

Note: It has http components and while running through heroku some features might not work as it uses https. So change https to http in the url and the application works correctly.
